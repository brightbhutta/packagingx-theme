Speak with one of our representatives via live chat, fill out an online form, or call us directly at the number provided, and once you have finalized the type and quantity of custom printed boxes that you needs, our member will answer any questions you have about the artwork, mockups design, or anything else related to your order. When you are satisfied, the details of your order will be confirmed, and an invoice will be sent to you for order confirmation. After you have submitted your invoice, the next step is to preview your artwork! We will create and share 2D and 3D mockups of your boxes based on the artwork you provide before printing them. This means you will be able to see every detail of your design from every angle before putting it into production. Once you have reviewed and approved the designs, your order will be processed and shipped to you within the time frame specified for your specific requirements.</p>

                                <p>While turnaround time for custom box orders varies depending on each customers unique specifications, our standard turnaround time is 8-10 business days after final design approval. Bulk or rigid custom box orders may necessitate additional production and/or shipping time, which we will notify you in advance. While we strive for extreme accuracy in our stated turnaround times, delivery estimates cannot be guaranteed. If your delivery date is critical, we strongly advise you to discuss rush manufacturing and timely shipping with your customer service rep.</p>

                                <h5>Is it possible to print artwork on both the inside and outside of the box?</h5>
                                <p>Yes! We frequently print 2-sided boxes with your artwork on both sides of the custom boxes. We can print on both the outside (1-side) and the inside of boxes (2-side). There may be additional charges for 2-sided printing; please discuss this with your customer service representative for more information.</p>

                                <h4>Do you offer discounts for bulk orders and how can I lower my unit price?</h4>
                                <p>Yes! As a general rule, pricing becomes more cost-effective as order quantity increases, so the larger your box quantities, the lower your per unit price. Your box dimensions, box style, ink coverage on the box, box material, and quantity all influence pricing. PackagingX, a leading custom packaging manufacturer in USA, offers the most competitive rates on custom printed boxes currently offered. If you find a lower price elsewhere, we will work to match it. We believe in upfront pricing and work hard to keep our reputation as the most affordable custom packaging provider.</p>
